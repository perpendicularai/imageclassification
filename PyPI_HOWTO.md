# A python program to detect face liveness in an image

## Usage :

### - pip install fakefaceinf

### - import fakefaceinf as ffi
### - res = ffi.predict_and_process_image('/path/to/your/image/jpg')
### - print(res)


## Important Notes

### - Please ensure that you create a directory called `models` to download and save the model from the following url : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KNxjyd-FAB5TQ3KYUIU-w-3XtJs8c1QF and save it to the `models` directory as `models\fakefacedetect`. Without this step being performed, the package will not work.
